## News

This past Tuesday Manjula Jonnalagadda gave a thorough overview of [Auto Layout and Size Classes.](http://www.meetup.com/Advanced-iOS-Objective-C/members/3983484/) Her suggestions were to ensure you consider each devices strengths and weaknesses. Ensure you are utilizing layout guides, and do perform your layout from the middle out. Using the Any x Any size class can get you pretty far. (slides should be posted at the link above shortly)

A couple weeks back I gave a talk on iOS testing, the trunout was great and we all learned a lot. If you are interested in testing I would love to help you get started at one of our regular meetups. If you are not the leaving the house type there are some links below too.

Since we are all mobile (or aspiring) developers, a great mind in the mobile space Ben Evans wrote about [16 mobile theses](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/12/15/16-mobile-theses).

[Phil Schiller](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/12/17Apple-Names-Jeff-Williams-Chief-Operating-Officer.html) is now the head of the App Store for Apple. We'll keep on eye on how this changes things.

## Projects from this week
Francisco is looking for feedback on his [autolayout helper library](https://github.com/franciscojma86/autolayout)

One member wanted feedback on an app that has an algorithm that reads your face and tells you your personality.

One SJSU student built a location-based events app and another one that helps you find roommates on campus.

We helped one new face build a weather app by connecting to the [Dark Skys API](https://developer.forecast.io).

One gentleman was working on building a hangman app using [drawRect](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIView_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIView/drawRect:).

We also had members looking for inspiration on learning iOS (hopefully we helped!) and advice with [NSNotificationCenter](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/).

## Culture
In case you missed it, SpaceX is doing amazing things. They landed their rocket after sending 11 satellites into space. Check out the incredible feat [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B6oiLNyKKI). It looks like the "At Sea" landing [just needs a few more tweaks](https://www.instagram.com/p/BAqirNbwEc0/):w

There was a great podcast a couple weeks back on the Talk Show with John Gruber where Craig Federighi gave his thoughts on open sourcing Swift and the future of Swift. You can hear it right [here](https://overcast.fm/+Btux5YtLE).

## Resources

Code Path has been kind enough to share the curriculum for their [Swift Basics](http://guides.codepath.com/ios/Swift-Basics)

Members are gathering an interest in [More advanced Swift Topics](ihttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-408/)

Some great videos from the Functional Swift conference can be found [here](http://2015.funswiftconf.com/).
