# iOS Developer Connect Newsletter
Monday Dec 7, 2015

Hello iOS Connect Members. It's been an exciting week for iOS Developers. Our Sunday Project Group at Hacker Dojo Mountain View continues to be a huge success. Our Tuesday Events continue to be a great place to engage in discussions about the week's latest news, ask about new API or for quick pairing session. 

## News
The biggest news for the week is the open sourcing of Swift. With the source on GitHub and Pull Requests being accepted from the community, now is a great time to be a Swift Developer.

The project home page is at [Swift.org](http://swift.org) There you can read about the Compiler, Standard Libraries, and the Package Manager. I highly recommend the [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/#api-design-guidelines)
which detail some of the changes coming in Swift 3.0.

If you are feeling up to it checkout the [guidelines to contributing](https://swift.org/contributing/) and put your mark on the new [Foundation (Certified Obj-C free) Library](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation) The [Project Group Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/SantaClara-iOS/) would be a great place for this kind of work.

Just want to write your first few lines of Swift? Try out the [IBM Swift Sandbox](http://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net/?cm_mmc=developerWorks-_-dWdevcenter-_-swift-_-lp#/repl)

## Projects from yesterday
We had an amazing group of learners yesterday at the Project Group Meetup. It is great to be in such a diverse learning environment. From the UI layer through the data layer and everything in between. There were people working with
[Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIFont_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006891) and [AutoLayout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853), [TableViews](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableView_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006943), [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001075).

We even had a few members giving Functional Reactive Programming a try using the [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) library!

## Resources
Learning Core Data can be a challenge. There is a great tutorial series over at [Tuts+ Core Data](). The series walks through setting up the stack, reading and writing data, up to Fetched Results Controllers and more! The tutorials are all 
focused on the task at hand and build up slowly. I hope you find them useful.

## Finally
[Be Nice. Orta says it best!](https://realm.io/news/altconf-orta-therox-being-nice-in-open-source/)
Have a great week!
