We are slowly adjusting to the setup as Hacker Dojo settling down into its new location.  Please do let us know how well this new location is working out for you by emailing me at GloriaSu2188@gmail.com.

The most effective way to learn is when you actually sit down and put your hands on it. Development happens faster when you are among peers who can quickly answer your how-to questions and help you troubleshoot. 

This is the place to make progress. No formal structure, just helpfulness and collaboration.

Start your iOS on-line tutorial, write your first app, add a new feature, or integrate a new API? Or you're an experienced iOS developer that enjoys parallel-programming or looking for project work? You can be working on any project (iOS or otherwise) and join us to make progress. No pressure to stay the entire duration, join anytime and leave when you need to. Many of our members have developed their first iOS app just by coming to this group. Who knows what you can accomplish when being part of this hands-on study group. This event is becoming a regular work and study session for many, and some techies are becoming our very own mentor-in-resident. Bring your laptop and we'll dive in.
