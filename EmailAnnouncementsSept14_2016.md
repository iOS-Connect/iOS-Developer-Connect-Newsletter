#Santa Clara iOS Connect Sunday Project Announcement

Hello fellow Swifers! You must have installed Xcode 8 and started to use the latest and greatest Swift 3! But as you all know, the new version has significant changes which means there could be lots of frustration and confusion during the transition period.

Worry no more! Come join this Sunday meetup and together we will unlock the goodies inside Swift 3! We will give you some good and compact coverage of the basics of the latest version Swift as well as some best practices.

We had a tremendous success last Sunday working on the [Walmart API app](https://github.com/iOS-Connect/WalmartTrending). For this coming Sunday, let's get some hands-on experience with Swift 3 and rewrite the app using the latest programming language from Apple!

Looking forward to see all of you this Sunday!
