# iOS Developer Connect Newsletter
Tuesday Dec 15, 2015

Hello iOS Connect Members. We continue to have great turnouts at the Sunday and Tuesday events. Some come with lists filled with questions and others come in prepared to answer as many questions as possible. We keep having new visitors each time as well.

## News 
Open source Swift continues to be at the forefront of the discussion and now has almost 200 contributors and nearly 230 pull requests have been merged.

Someone has already managed to run a Swift ["Hello, world"](https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/674834843188994048) program in Android.

First independent Swift language [evolution accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2015-December/000001.html), proposed by well known iOS dev and author [@ericasadun](https://twitter.com/ericasadun).

Swift is the top trending repository on Github [this week](https://github.com/trending?since=weekly).


## Projects from this week

We continue to have a diverse set of goals that members are trying to accomplish. [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001075) continues to be a challenge. [Parse](https://parse.com/) is a popular backend that some of us have questions about. 

On Tuesday we talked about [UI Collection View Cell Selection](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionView_class/), [Grand Central Dispatch](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/) and [Pure Layout](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout).

## Culture

We talked about a couple great iOS podcasts [ATP.fm](http://atp.fm/) and [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/) as well as a wonderful business/tech podcast called [ExponentFM](http://exponent.fm/).
