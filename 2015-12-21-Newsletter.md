# iOS Developer Connect Newsletter
Tuesday Dec 22, 2015

We had a ton of new members show up this week! Thank you for showing up and we hope to continue seeing new faces. Again, we had every level from people who were just getting started to some who had apps in the App Store already. We had some entrepreneurs who were looking for feedback for their apps in the store as well.

NOTES: Johns talk on Tuesday, maybe some links to testing resources as well as sample project. 
    We need to make sure we are linking to the meetup pages for the Group.

Since we are all mobile (or aspiring) developers, a great mind in the mobile space  Ben Evans wrote about [16 mobile theses](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/12/15/16-mobile-theses).

[Phil Schiller](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/12/17Apple-Names-Jeff-Williams-Chief-Operating-Officer.html) is now the head of the App Store for Apple. We'll keep on eye on how this changes things.

## Projects from this week
One member wanted feedback on an app that has an algorithm that reads your face and tells you your personality.

We helped one new face build a weather app by connecting to the [Dark Skys API](https://developer.forecast.io).

One gentleman was working on building a hangman app using [drawRect](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIView_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIView/drawRect:).

We also had members looking for inspiration on learning iOS (hopefully we helped!) and advice with [NSNotificationCenter](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/).
