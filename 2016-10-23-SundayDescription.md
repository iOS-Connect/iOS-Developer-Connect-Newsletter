## Animations Sunday

ðŸ“² This coming sunday will be all about animations. ðŸ“² We are going to look at some Core Animation basics. UIView animation, with constraints and autosizing table view cells. We will look at 2 sample projects, one to impliment a clock face, and a simple input build on a table view where the cells will size to fit the extra content.

The most effective way to learn is when you sit down and put your hands on it. Development happens faster when you are among peers who can quickly answer your questions and help you troubleshoot. 

This is the place to make progress.

Start your iOS on-line tutorial, write your first app, add a new feature, or integrate a new API? Or you're an experienced iOS developer that enjoys pair-programming or looking for project work? You can be working on any project (iOS or otherwise) and join us to make progress. No pressure to stay the entire duration, join anytime and leave when you need to. Many of our members have developed their first iOS app just by coming to this group. Who knows what you can accomplish when being part of this hands-on study group. This event is becoming a regular work and study session for many, and some techies are becoming our very own mentor-in-resident. Bring your laptop and we'll dive in.
