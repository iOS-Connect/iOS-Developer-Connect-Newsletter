# iOS Developer Connect Newsletter
January 28, 2016

## News
Xcode 7.3beta2 was released this week, bringing with it a slew of new warning for Swift developers. The new warnings are added in Swift 2.2 to warn developers of functionality that will be removed in Swift3. The most visible of these changes are the removal of `++` and `--` (the pre/post-fix increment and decrement counters) and "c-style" for loops 
`for(i = 0; i < count; i++){}`
You can find the new beta in the [developer center](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/).

## Projects from this week

If Applicable

## Culture

[Keeping up with Tim Cook's Apple](http://rd2.io/2016/01/tim-cooks-apple/) Contains really interesting analysis of Apples recent innovations, and how to ship software that enhances future hardware. Really thoughtful stuff. 

## Resources

[A surprisingly long article came out recently about writing your first iOS Framework](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/creating-your-first-ios-framework). I am thinking of taking the time this Sunday to work through it. Seems that creating an iOS Framework is a bit more nuanced than I had originaly suspected. 

[How to do an onboarding screen](http://blog.johnregner.com/post/117370086123/ios-onboarding-how-to) was discussed this week too!

## Anouncements Looking Ahead

[A Guided Interactive Adventure in iOS](http://www.meetup.com/SantaClara-iOS/events/228163662/)
I am really exited for our big monthly event on Sunday. Manjula will be giving an all afternoon master class on iOS development. If you've been on the fence about making the leap, this is the event for you. Other members will be there along side you learing and our more experienced members will be around to make sure all your questions have answers.
